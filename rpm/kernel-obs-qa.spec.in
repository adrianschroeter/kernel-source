%description
This package is using the kernel compiled within Open Build Service(OBS)
projects and runs basic tests.

# More tests are comming, currently the main test is the existens of
# this spec file. It does trigger a build within OBS VM which is using
# the kernel of the same project.

# test suites should be packaged in other packages, but build required
# and called here.
